ChatBot AI Assistant for Online Stores

This project is a smart chatbot assistant built in Python, using the Together AI API for natural language processing. It's designed to assist online stores by answering customer questions automatically — reducing the need for human support while improving the shopping experience.

🧠 What It Does

The chatbot can:

Answer product-related questions (e.g. “Do you have black hoodies?”)
Provide details like availability, price, sizes, and colors
Simulate a human-like conversation with customers
Help boost sales by guiding customers to the right products
🛍 Example Use Case

Let’s say a customer asks:

“Do you have black hoodies?”
The chatbot could reply:

“Yes! We have black hoodies available in sizes M and L for 70 euros.”
You (as the store owner or developer) just provide the bot with your product data, and the language model takes care of the rest.

🔍 Upcoming Features

Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG):
Work in progress — product information will soon be uploaded as documents or files, which the bot can retrieve from during the conversation to give accurate, up-to-date answers.
